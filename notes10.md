**TAILWIND CSS**
Will allow us to write CSS without leaving HTML page

It is very light weight

For Installation chehck chatgpt / browser

Directly write styles in the className

Tailwind CSS Intellisense - vs code extension - will give suggestions while writing Tailwind classes

For hardcoded value use []
ex: w-[200px]

Some times extension doesn't give us suggestions, then click "CTRL + SPACE" on the keyboard

CONS: 
due to writing everything in className, code will look ugly and we have to comprimise the readability also

For Dark mode -> use "dark:"
